# The Kotlin Scripting experiment

The [Kotlin Scripting support KEEP](https://github.com/Kotlin/KEEP/blob/master/proposals/scripting-support.md#kotlin-scripting-support), KEEP-75, specifies the new, long term support API for defining Kotlin scripts.

The `kotlin-dsl` must eventually migrate to this API (because supported) and this experiment is about assessing its cost and opportunities. 

## Running

    ./gradlew run -q
    
## Notes

 - Running `main` from the IDE doesn't work
